A simple, easy to use and quite powerful tool to create, manage and embed interactive charts into your WordPress posts and pages.

== Description ==

WordPress Visualizer plugin is a simple, easy to use and quite powerful tool to create, manage and embed interactive charts into your WordPress posts and pages.

The plugin uses Google Visualization API to render charts, which support cross-browser compatibility (adopting VML for older IE versions) and cross-platform portability to iOS and new Android releases.

### 9 Chart types ###
The plugin provides a variety of charts that are optimized to address your data visualization needs. It is line chart, area chart, bar chart, column chart, pie chart, geo chart, gauge chart, candlestick chart and scatter chart. These charts are based on pure HTML5/SVG technology (adopting VML for old IE versions), so no extra plugins are required. Adding these charts to your page can be done in a few simple steps.

### Flexible and customizable ###
Make the charts your own. Configure an extensive set of options to perfectly match the look and feel of your website. You can use Google Chart Tools with their default setting - all customization is optional and the basic setup is launch-ready. However, charts can be easily customizable in case your webpage adopts a style which is at odds with provided defaults. Every chart exposes a number of options that customize its look and feel.

### HTML5/SVG ###
Charts are rendered using HTML5/SVG technology to provide cross-browser compatibility (including VML for older IE versions) and cross platform portability to iPhones, iPads and Android. Your users will never have to mess with extra plugins or any software. If they have a web browser, they can see your charts.
